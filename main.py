# Take the input from the flights.txt file and parse it
# The input is in the format of: <day of week, month, day of month, departure time; carrier; price; flight arrival time; day of week, month, day of month, departure time; departure arrival time>
# The output should be the best flight based on total price (ticket, parking, rental car)

# First, we need to parse the input file





# Second, we need to calculate the total price of each flight
# Take the flight ticket price from the file then use if/else statements to add parking and transportation
# Parking is $12 per day
# If we arrive before 9AM, I need to add $30 for an uber
# If we arrive after 8PM, I need to add $30 for a rental car
# Else, $0 for transportation




# Third, we need to find the best flight based on total price
# The best flight is the one with the lowest total price
